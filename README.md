# Real_World_Weather_Plugin
The scripts from the Unity Real World Weather Javascript Plugin Project

LightManager is the major script in terms of changing the actual state of the Unity scene.
callToJs is the C# script that handles the calling of Javascript functions from the plugin.
jsLibrary.jslib merges the Javascript functions into the Unity libraries so they can be accessed.
external.js contains the actual Javascript code that accesses the weather API.
